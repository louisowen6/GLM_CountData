## Background

- Smoking is an activity that is commonly done for some groups, especially men
- Smoking does not give any positive impacts

This project aims to:
1. Build a regression model that can model the number of male deaths based on age categories and types of cigarettes consumed
2. Knowing the age categories of men and the types of cigarettes consumed which results in the highest and lowest mortality rates
